This is a website project made by me and two other people in my Principles of Information and Data Management class. The goal of this project was to understand how to to run a 
website and manage data held in a database. The website utilizes Java Server Pages, and uses the Java, HTML and MySQL languages. The website was about train schedules and their
information, including what stops, arrival and departure times, and route numbers they contained. The main page would display the current schedules of the upcoming stops and would
automatically remove themselves when the departure time passed. In addition, customers could create accounts with usernames and passwords, and would store information like names 
and emails. Customers could create reservations and delete them, which would all be stored on a MySQL RDS instance on AWS. Employees could also make accounts and would be given 
access to restricted features of the websites. The website was hosted on an EC2 instance on AWS, and the project fully utilizes front-end, back-end, and database concepts. The 
project had multiple stages such as planning out schema and table dependencies for the database. My main role was creating the login page, the customer account management page, 
the reservation creation page and the error pages.
